%h2 Will the project appear immediately on the site after being sent?
%p
  Actually, no. We
  %strong select projects
  to appear on this website. We call this process curatorship: Our intention is to disclose only projects that are nice and ready to go public asking for financial support. But do not worry: we are very open about what is a cool project :)
%h2 What kind of projects are accepted to the site?
%p We're open arms for art projects - Fine Arts, Circus, Dance, Movies, Photography, Music, Theatre, etc.. - And also for creative projects that arise in fields such as Food, Design, Fashion, Technology, Games, Comics, Journalism, among others.
%p
  %strong We do not accept charities
  Not that we do not like these projects or do not think are important: far from it. But this site focuses on creative projects. However, if your project involves a social cause and is creative at the same time, we will accept it quietly.
%p
  %strong We do not finance projects, only companies.
  It's great if your company is working a specific project but we mean that interest rates are tied to the company itself so think of this as a loan to your business as a whole and not to an individual deliverable product. The company must pay back the loan in cash and not through goods or other deliverables.
%p If you have any questions, just send us an email #{mail_to t('site.email.contact'), "here"}.
